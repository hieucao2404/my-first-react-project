I. Component
    - React applications are entirely made out of compenents
    - Buildding blocks of user interface in React
    - Piece of UI that has it own data, login and appearance (how it works and looks)
    - Build complex by building multiple components and combining them
    - Components can be reused, nested inside each other and pass data between

    --> How to breaks design into compents
    Component Tree:
    App - Video Player
    	- Menu
    	- Refine Questions(Parent compnent) - Filter (Child component)
    	- Questions List - Question

    Component
    - Only return exacly one element
    - Nested does not means write the function in another, but include components
    - In realword we divide code in to module
    - We can call each component multiple times to reuse it  

II. WHAT is JSX ????
	- An extension of JS
	- Component contains data, logic, appearence
	- Declaratice syntax to describe what components look like and how they word
	- Components must return a block of JSX
	- Extension of JS that allow us to embed JS CSS and React components into HTML 
	- Each JSX elements is converted to a React.createElement function
	- We could use React without JSX but does not effective and hard to understand

	JSX is DECALREATIVE!!
	- IMPERATIVE: (How to do things)
		- Manaue DOM element selections and DOM traversing
		- Step-by-step DOM mutaions until we reach the desired UI
	- DECLARATIVE: (What you wants)
		- Describe what UI should look like using JSX, based on current data
		- No DOM manipulation
		- React is an abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM
		- Instead, we think of the UI has a reflection of the current data

III. Seperation of Concern!
	1. Rise of interactive SPAs
		- One technology per file (traditional)
	2. JS is in charge of HTML
		- HTML does not make sense without JS
	3. Logic and UI are tightly coupled
	4. Why keep them seperated
	5. React Component + JSX

	Component includes - Data
					   - Logic
					   - Appearance
	All in 1 file

	In React we have one component per file (React sepetration of concern)
	- Each component is concerned with one piece of the UI
